                        <p>
                        The activities of complex microbial communities shape our planet and affect the health of the humans. In our group we employ metagenomics and taxonomic marker gene sequencing to explore patterns of microbial diversity and reconstruct genomes and metabolic pathways of microbes in environments ranging from the Baltic Sea to the rumen of Moose. We also develop molecular and bioinformatics tools for enhancing the information output from such studies. An introduction to metagenomics and amplicon sequencing can be found <a href="/metagenomics.html#main">here</a>.

                                        Anders received his PhD in 2005 at KTH Royal Institute of Technology after graduate studies on functional genomics.  Thereafter he conducted postdoctoral studies at the Karolinska Institute, University of California Berkeley, and Uppsala University, working on metagenomics approaches to study microbial communities of different environments (the human gut microbiota, biofilms of acid mine drainage, and bacterioplankton of lakes and the Baltic Sea). In 2010 he returned to KTH, starting his tenure track and building up a group at Science for Life Laboratory in Stockholm. In 2014 he was promoted to associate professor.

									<p>Vesna received her PhD in May 2018 at University of South Bohemia, Czech Republic. Her research investigated predator-prey interactions at the level of microbial eukaryotes and their bacterial prey, combining single-cell microscopic techniques and molecular methods.</p>
                                    <p>She began her postdoc in the Environmental Genomics group at KTH/Scilifelab in 2019, and is developing a novel method for coupled high-throughput single-cell transcriptomics and microscopy of eukaryotic plankton. The project is done in collaboration with other groups at SciLifeLab and at Stockholm University.</p>

										<h3>Meike Latz</h3>
									</header>
									<p>Meike has a background in molecular/microbiology from RWTH Aachen (DE) and University of Exeter (UK). She received her PhD in microbiology from the University of Copenhagen (DK) in June 2019, where she investigated plant-associated fungi using metabarcoding and transcriptomics. Her general research interest lies in microbe – environment interactions, how environmental factors influence microbial community abundance, composition, and functions in the environment.
									</p>Since September 2019, as a postdoctoral fellow at SciLifeLab and KTH, Meike develops molecular and bioinformatic methods to advance metabarcoding for higher taxonomic coverage and resolution. She applies these methods for environmental monitoring of plankton in the Baltic sea, with a special focus on non-indigenous species and harmful algae. This is a collaborative project with Umeå University and SMHI.

                                    <p>Jürg's general research interest lies in the ecology of micro-organisms within aquatic ecosystems. He is using microbial communities as model systems to address questions related to community ecology. He is particularly interested in understanding the mechanisms that underlie patterns of microbial species distribution, abundance, and interactions as well as the links between microbial diversity and ecosystem functioning.</p>

The project has the ultimate goal to produce new enzymes that efficiently converts renewable plant biomass into biofuels. The strategy is to refine highly potent degraders of lignocellulose (the most abundant renewable biomass on earth) by iterative culturing. The enzymes will be identified by shotgun metagenomics and transcriptomics followed by recombinant gene expression. </p>
                                    
                                    <p>Olov received his PhD from the Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences (SLU) investigating a connection with spiral shaped Treponema bacteria and ulcers from which pigs may suffer. In between PhD and post-doctoral studies, Olov spent a year developing next generation sequencing applications for clinical microbiology diagnostics at the University hospital of Linköping.</p>
