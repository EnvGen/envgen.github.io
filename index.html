                        </h2>
                        <p>
                        The activities of complex microbial communities shape our planet and affect the health of the humans. In our group we employ metagenomics and taxonomic marker gene sequencing to explore patterns of microbial diversity and reconstruct genomes and metabolic pathways of microbes in environments ranging from the Baltic Sea to the rumen of Moose. We also develop molecular and bioinformatics tools for enhancing the information output from such studies. An introduction to metagenomics and amplicon sequencing can be found <a href="/metagenomics.html#main">here</a>.

                                        Anders received his PhD in 2005 at KTH Royal Institute of Technology after graduate studies on functional genomics.  Thereafter he conducted postdoctoral studies at the Karolinska Institute, University of California Berkeley, and Uppsala University, working on metagenomics approaches to study microbial communities of different environments (the human gut microbiota, biofilms of acid mine drainage, and bacterioplankton of lakes and the Baltic Sea). In 2010 he returned to KTH, starting his tenure track and building up a group at Science for Life Laboratory in Stockholm. In 2014 he was promoted to associate professor.

										<h3>Luisa W. Hugerth</h3>

									<p>Luisa is a PhD student working on microbial communities in the Baltic Sea. She uses shotgun sequencing to reconstruct genomes from uncultured organisms and explore their metabolism. As a complement to that, she applies amplicon sequencing to investigate population dynamics over time. </p>
                                    <p>In collaboration with other groups, Luisa is exploring these same approaches in other environments, such as soils and the human gut.</p>

										<h3>Conny Sjöqvist</h3>

									<p>Conny received his PhD in September 2015 at Åbo Akademi University (Finland) after population genetic studies on phytoplankton in the Baltic Sea. 
									
									Since October, 2015 he is a Post-doctoral researcher at KTH Royal Institute of Technology studying population genomic patterns of dominant bacterioplankton along environmental gradients in the Baltic Sea. By the use of metagenomic methods he describes microbial communities in the area and aim at revealing patterns of intra-specific diversity and differentiation. Such knowledge may contribute to a better understanding of current selection pressures and evolution of microbial communities in the Baltic Sea.</p>

                                    <p>The first projects Johannes have been involved with concerns clustering of metagenomic contigs, reconstructing dominant baltic sea bacterioplankton and using microbial signatures for water quality assessment. Johannes is co-first author of CONCOCT and currently maintaining the code.</p>

                                    <p>Jürg is a PostDoctoral Research Fellow and is currently working on how bacterial communities of different aquatic origin differ in the processing of dissolved organic matter of terrestrial origin (in collaboration with Anders Andersson, KTH Stockholm, and Emma Kritzberg, Lund University).</p>
                                    <p>Jürg's general research interest lies in the ecology of micro-organisms within aquatic ecosystems. He is using microbial communities as model systems to address questions related to community ecology. He is particularly interested in understanding the mechanisms that underlie patterns of microbial species distribution, abundance, and interactions as well as the links between microbial diversity and ecosystem functioning.</p>
