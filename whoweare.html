									<h3>Anders Andersson (PI)</h3>
								</header>
                                    				<p>
                                        				Anders received his PhD in 2005 at KTH Royal Institute of Technology after graduate studies on functional genomics.  Thereafter he conducted postdoctoral studies at the Karolinska Institute, University of California Berkeley, and Uppsala University, working on metagenomics approaches to study microbial communities of different environments (the human gut microbiota, biofilms of acid mine drainage, and bacterioplankton of lakes and the Baltic Sea). In 2010 he returned to KTH, starting his tenure track and building up a group at Science for Life Laboratory in Stockholm. In 2014 he was promoted to associate professor.

										<h3>Vesna Grujcic</h3>
									</header>
									<p>Vesna received her PhD in May 2018 at University of South Bohemia, Czech Republic. Her research investigated predator-prey interactions at the level of microbial eukaryotes and their bacterial prey, combining single-cell microscopic techniques and molecular methods.</p>
                                    <p>She began her postdoc in the Environmental Genomics group at KTH/Scilifelab in 2019, and is developing a novel method for coupled high-throughput single-cell transcriptomics and microscopy of eukaryotic plankton. The project is done in collaboration with other groups at SciLifeLab and at Stockholm University.</p>

										<h3>Meike Latz</h3>
									</header>
									<p>Meike has a background in molecular/microbiology from RWTH Aachen (DE) and University of Exeter (UK). She received her PhD in microbiology from the University of Copenhagen (DK) in June 2019, where she investigated plant-associated fungi using metabarcoding and transcriptomics. Her general research interest lies in microbe – environment interactions, how environmental factors influence microbial community abundance, composition, and functions in the environment.
									</p>Since September 2019, as a postdoctoral fellow at SciLifeLab and KTH, Meike develops molecular and bioinformatic methods to advance metabarcoding for higher taxonomic coverage and resolution. She applies these methods for environmental monitoring of plankton in the Baltic sea, with a special focus on non-indigenous species and harmful algae. This is a collaborative project with Umeå University and SMHI.
